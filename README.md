# COVID info for me

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### This was a quick build because back in March, 2020, I was annoyed that I was not able to easily locate more localized information for COVID-19 new cases in my city/county.  Thus, I found an API that gathered that data, https://covid19-us-api.herokuapp.com, and built this simple app to relay that information in a readable manner.

#### I hope you find it helpful as we all try to stay informed and safe.
